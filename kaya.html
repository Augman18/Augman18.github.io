<a>This is my friend Kaya!!! 🏀</a>
<div id="photo"></div>
<p></p>
<a>He is awesome sauce at basketball!</a>
<a>Kaya has many great qualities such as flicking very hard and just being an all around great guy.😁👍 Kaya and I met at Brant Lake Camp and have furthered our friendship through our chats in the hallways at the Dalton School as well as playing basketball together. Kaya's ability to put a smile on everyone's face is an extraordinary skill. Kaya's way of making the whole room erupt in laughter and deescalating a situation is envied by many. Haters wanna say Kaya is only a basketball player, but really he is a genius and highly intelligent individual. He is a son, brother, student, athlete, and leader. Ur such a great guy! 🩶</a>
